  title: 'Lab 03: Conditional Access for Zava Agent Identities'
  description: In this lab, you created a custom security attribute set named AgentAttributes with an AgentApprovalStatus attribute containing five predefined governance values. You assigned the HRApproved approval status to the Zava HR Assistant, establishing a structured agent classification model in Entra ID. You created the Zava - Block Unapproved Agent Identities Conditional Access policy targeting all agent identities and excluding those with approved attribute values. You used the What If tool in Report-only mode to validate that an approved agent is correctly excluded from the block policy, then switched the policy to enforcement mode. You created the Zava - Block High Risk Agent Identities policy using Entra ID Protection agent risk signals and set it to Report-only pending risk signal generation. Patti Fernandes invoked the Zava HR Assistant to generate sign-in events, which you then investigated in the Service principal sign-in logs filtered by agent type. Zava's agent identities are now governed by Zero Trust Conditional Access controls.

# Lab 03: Conditional Access for Zava Agent Identities

## Introduction

Zava's CISO has mandated that only reviewed and approved AI agents may access company resources. Any agent that has not been through the governance review process must be blocked automatically. Additionally, if any agent identity shows signs of compromise — such as anomalous token acquisition behaviour — it must be blocked immediately without manual intervention.

MOD Administrator will implement both controls using Conditional Access for Agent Identities (Preview). Patti Fernandes will validate that policy evaluation is visible in sign-in logs. This lab establishes the Zava agent governance baseline that all subsequent security labs build upon.

Conditional Access for Agent Identities is a preview capability in Microsoft Entra ID that extends Zero Trust controls to AI agents. MOD Administrator will create custom security attributes to classify the approval status of each Zava agent, build a Conditional Access policy that blocks all unapproved agent identities from accessing organisational resources, and create a second policy that blocks any agent identity exhibiting high-risk behaviour based on Entra ID Protection signals. The policies will first be validated in Report-only mode before being switched to enforcement. Patti Fernandes will investigate agent sign-in events to confirm Conditional Access policy evaluation.

## Objectives

- Create a custom security attribute set and approval status attribute for agent classification.
- Assign approval status attributes to all three Zava agent identities.
- Create a Conditional Access policy that blocks all unapproved agent identities.
- Validate the policy scope using the What If tool to confirm an untagged agent would be blocked.
- Switch the policy to enforcement mode.
- Create a second Conditional Access policy that blocks high-risk agent identities.
- Generate agent sign-in events by invoking the Zava HR Assistant as Patti Fernandes.
- Investigate Conditional Access policy evaluation in agent identity sign-in logs.

9. Under **Access controls**, under **Grant**, make sure that **Block access** is selected.

10. Under **Enable policy**, select **Report-only**.

    > **Note:** This policy is set to Report-only because agent risk signals from Entra ID Protection require active agent usage over time before risk levels are generated. In a newly provisioned lab environment, no risk signals will be present yet. Report-only mode allows the policy to be evaluated against future sign-in events without blocking access prematurely. In a production environment, this policy would be switched to On once baseline risk signal data is established.

11. Select **Create** to save the policy.

	![](./media/image66.png)

12. On the **Policies** page, confirm that **Zava - Block High Risk Agent Identities** appears with a status of **Report-only**.

## Summary

In this lab, you created a custom security attribute set named **AgentAttributes** with an **AgentApprovalStatus** attribute containing five predefined governance values. You assigned the **HR_Approved** approval status to the Zava HR Assistant, establishing a structured agent classification model in Entra ID. You created the **Zava - Block Unapproved Agent Identities** Conditional Access policy targeting all agent identities and excluding those with approved attribute values. You used the What If tool in Report-only mode to validate that an approved agent is correctly excluded from the block policy, then switched the policy to enforcement mode. You created the **Zava - Block High Risk Agent Identities** policy using Entra ID Protection agent risk signals and set it to Report-only pending risk signal generation. Patti Fernandes invoked the Zava HR Assistant to generate sign-in events, which you then investigated in the Service principal sign-in logs filtered by agent type. Zava's agent identities are now governed by Zero Trust Conditional Access controls.
